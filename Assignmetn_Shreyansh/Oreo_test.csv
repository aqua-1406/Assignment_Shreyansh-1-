For reference here is some general information on this method | ""Employ Benchmarking by identifying industry leaders in the same space and compare current practices to theirs, pinpointing where improvements can be made.""Brief Summary: Benchmarking is a process of comparing one's business processes and performance metrics to industry bests or best practices from other industries. Objective: The objective of benchmarking is to find examples of superior performance and understand the processes and practices driving that performance. Inputs Required: Data on one's own performance; information about best practices in the industry or other industries. Step-by-Step Use: 1. Identify what to benchmark: Determine which processes or performance metrics to compare. 2. Identify comparison targets: Find organizations known for their excellence in these areas. 3. Collect data: Gather data on how these organizations achieve their performance levels. 4. Analyze the data: Identify gaps in performance and areas for improvement. 5. Implement findings: Develop strategies to close performance gaps, applying what has been learned from the benchmarks. Tips for Effective Use: - Ensure accurate and relevant comparisons by choosing the right benchmarks. - Look beyond direct competitors to best practice leaders in other industries. - Use benchmarking as a continuous process, not a one-time event. - Engage teams across the organization for a broad perspective. - Document and share the insights gained from benchmarking exercises. | Note: please briefly describe this method before providing results",[Our Business],"[Our business] is defined as follows

We are running out of OREO flavors and consumer are not that excited about the new flavors we bring out.

To maintain consumer interest we would like to develop new OREO products with a link to our traditional OREO brand flavors. We believe this will generate interest and strengthen the brand
Objectives: 
10 authentic new oreo inspired products we can test with consumers
Restrictions (we are not interested in)
New flavors not linked to the original oreo taste 
Tactical Constraints 
We need to leverage our core brand image and further strengthen the brand
We need to leverage our traditional orea cookie flavor
Here are the places to start 
Oreo products to compliment other products such as a topping for ice cream
Oreos are sweet- could we combine them with savoury foods
Associations with other leading brands to build both brands
Assets/Opportunities (that will help us achieve our goals)


A very strong brand with lots of brand loyalty
Strong retail presence
Blockers (that might make things difficult)

To maintain consumer interest we would like to develop new OREO products with a link to our traditional OREO brand flavors. We believe this will generate interest and strengthen the brand
Objectives: 
10 authentic new oreo inspired products we can test with consumers
Restrictions (we are not interested in)
New flavors not linked to the original oreo taste 
Tactical Constraints 
We need to leverage our core brand image and further strengthen the brand
We need to leverage our traditional orea cookie flavor
Here are the places to start 
Oreo products to compliment other products such as a topping for ice cream
Oreos are sweet- could we combine them with savoury foods
Associations with other leading brands to build both brands
Assets/Opportunities (that will help us achieve our goals)


A very strong brand with lots of brand loyalty
Strong retail presence
Blockers (that might make things difficult)
Consumers are getting tired with new flavors
Lots of competition in our market segment

","Please think like an innovation expert trying to clarify the business challenge we need to solve| 
Please provide 5 metrics that we could we best use to track progress on this challenge. What do these metrics is most important in this project ? Could we have one single metric

Truly Simple: 
New Authentic oreo products
Narrative (the story of our business)
We are running out of OREO flavors and consumer are not that excited about the new flavors we bring out.

To maintain consumer interest we would like to develop new OREO products with a link to our traditional OREO brand flavors. We believe this will generate interest and strengthen the brand
Objectives: 
10 authentic new oreo inspired products we can test with consumers
Restrictions (we are not interested in)
New flavors not linked to the original oreo taste 
Tactical Constraints 
We need to leverage our core brand image and further strengthen the brand
We need to leverage our traditional orea cookie flavor
Here are the places to start 
Oreo products to compliment other products such as a topping for ice cream
Oreos are sweet- could we combine them with savoury foods
Associations with other leading brands to build both brands
Assets/Opportunities (that will help us achieve our goals)


A very strong brand with lots of brand loyalty
